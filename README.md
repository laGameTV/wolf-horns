# About
**Wolf Horns** is a Minecraft datapack that introduces a new enchantment, "Call of the Wild", for goat horns, making it easier to manage large groups of tamed wolves. Once enchanted, these horns allow you to control your wolves with ease: simply use the horn to make all nearby tamed wolves stand, or hold shift while using it to command them to sit. The best part? It works perfectly in survival mode!
